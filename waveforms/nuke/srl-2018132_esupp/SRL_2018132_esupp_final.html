Using Waveform Cross Correlation for Detection, Location, and Identification of Aftershocks of the 2017 Nuclear Explosion at the North Korea Test Site</h2>
<p id="authors">by David P. Schaff, Won-Young Kim, Paul G. Richards, Eunyoung Jo, and Yonggyu Ryoo</p>
<p>This electronic supplement contains a map of area and stations used, a group velocity plot of seismograms, and tables of correlation values.</p>

<h3>Location Discussion</h3>
<p>We followed an identical procedure as described in Schaff <i>et al.</i> (2018) to obtain high-precision locations with only a few changes. For quality control, we first compute pairwise locations, use all pairs that are separated by 1 km or less, and then use that data to locate the largest cluster of events that is connected by a chain of these pairs. The changes we made were to search more than 3 s lags instead of 30 s, to use a correlation coefficient (CC) &ge;0.24 instead of 0.25, and to require three observations per pair instead of four. This resulted in 13 out of 14 events being locatable with high precision. They are all of high quality, but we comment on particular events here and how well constrained the cluster is.</p>
<p>Looking at Figures 2&ndash;4 in the main article and Figure S2, we can see which events form subclusters and are better constrained with respect to each other because these are relative locations. The observation matrix in Figure S2 shows all the connectivity of the event pairs with each other and the number of station observations for each event pair. Some of the spatial structure in Figure 2 is reflected in the similarity of the observation matrix and from the plots of the waveforms in Figures 3 and 4 in the main article, and it can be seen that events 2&ndash;9 form a subcluster and events 10&ndash;14 form another subcluster. These two subclusters are only connected through event 8, which was the master template used to detect the events. There are only three observations connecting the two subclusters (event pair 8 and 12), so the relative position of these two clusters is not as well constrained.</p>
<p>We perform two location runs: the first starting at a point and the second randomly perturbing the starting locations from a point by up to 1 km in Figure 2 in the main article. This measures the robustness of the locations and also shows how well constrained the locations of certain events and subclusters are with respect to other events. The ends of the gray lines are for the 1-km perturbation case, and the circles are for the starting-at-a-point case. It can be seen that most of the move vectors are small and fall within the error ellipses for most of the events and that the relative positions of the two subclusters do not change a lot between the two runs. The random perturbations are useful in determining robustness, relative connectivity and how well constrained the locations are.</p>
<p>To compute the relocated latitude and longitude from the relative locations, we move the centroid of our events 2&ndash;4 to the mean latitude and longitude of those corresponding events in Tian <i>et al.</i> (2018) because they have better relative locations of those with respect to the 2017 explosion.</p>
<p>Events 11 and 12 are not only similar and located close in space but occur only 23 s apart. Their relative locations are better constrained, with nine observing stations. They are also connected to other events, with three or more observations (see Fig. S2). Note that we are using 50 s windows for the <i>Lg</i> correlation measurement, so there is overlap of the two windows used for the correlation because the origin times are 23 s apart. This is not a problem, however, because we only allow the lags to be search over to be 3 s. So the window centered on the <i>Lg</i> arrival for event 11 cannot move to the <i>Lg</i> arrival for event 12. If it did it would produce an autocorrelation and the same origin times and relocated hypocenter. But as is seen from the locations, there are nonzero differential <i>Lg</i> travel times that cause a measurable offset in the locations of 11 with respect to 12. The corrections to the origin times are only a fraction of a second, not 23 s. A 50 s window produces two detection spikes for events 12 and 13, even though they are separated by 23 s. The presence of event 12 in the window for event 11 does not adversely change the timing of these arrival-time detection spikes but primarily only affects the measured correlation coefficient. Event 12 occurring later in the window aligned on event 11 is effectively uncorrelated noise because a similar waveform shape is not present later in the window aligned on event 12.</p>
<p>Also interesting to note is that event 7 is only connected to one other event, with three observations. For locating a pair of events, three observations are enough to obtain an exact solution but not an error estimate, because there are three unknowns for the epicenter and three observations. However, by locating event 7 together with other events in a cluster, it is possible to obtain a location and an error estimate because the other events in the cluster affect the position of the event it is connected to, event 8 in this case. Therefore, the exact solution for the event pair of 7 and 8 relative to each other is not what is obtained, but some other solution with nonzero residuals, so event 7 has nonzero error bars. This is helpful to know because, for sparse networks such as we have in this part of the world, sometimes we only have a few stations, and locating clusters of events with a minimum of three observations instead of four would enable locating a greater percentage of the events. Event 7 is the smallest magnitude event in the aftershock sequence, which is one reason why we have fewer observations.</p>
<p>Table S2 shows the mean, minimum, and maximum CC values and number of observations for each event. All of the events in the cluster have high mean values and high maximum values, indicating they belong to the cluster.</p>
<p>Figures S1, S3, and S4 reveal that some of the station ray paths cross oceanic crust from the test site. This has an effect of reducing the amplitudes of the <i>Lg</i> waves for several of those stations. The <i>Lg</i> group velocity that we use for the location program inversion is 3.5 km/s. Some of the stations have less energy at this group velocity (Figs. S3 and S4). Figure S1 and Table S3 color code these stations in terms of efficient <i>Lg</i> propagation at 3.5 km/s: red, good; blue, medium; black, weak. It is interesting that, for some stations such as SKC2, there is a mixed phase coming at 3.8 km/s group velocity that appears to be a combination of <i>Lg</i> and <i>Sn</i>. Surprisingly, although this station&rsquo;s path is almost entirely oceanic, color coded as black, it had 11 observations and a mean CC of 0.32 and maximum CC of 0.49 (Fig. S1 and Table S3). The standard deviation of the residuals was also quite low at 0.0084 s.</p>
<p>This is good news because we were able to use many of the blue and black stations, to have a total of 11 stations, to get good location results that explain the residuals well. The reason for this is that although the amplitude of <i>Lg</i> may be decreased for oceanic paths at group velocities of 3.5 km/s, correlation is able to detect similar waveforms, even with lower signal-to-noise ratios. So, as long as the waveforms are similar, the differential travel-time measurements can be very accurate. The location program simply models the waves as traveling with a group velocity of 3.5 km/s along straight-line, direct ray paths. Even if the phase measured at these stations with oceanic paths is not exactly what we would call <i>Lg</i>, as long as the energy arriving at 3.5 km/s group velocity has on average traveled along a direct ray path leaving the source, the location program is able to successfully invert the data to produce the high-precision location estimates that we obtained.</p>
<p>Table S4 shows the correlation measurements at station MDJ for the events in the cluster, demonstrating that event 8 is part of the cluster well connected to other events and very similar to event 9 (CC = 0.77). This event was described in the article as being a misclassification as an explosion, using discriminant data alone at station MDJ.</p>
<h3>Estimating Confidence in the Statistical Significance of Identification</h3>
<p>To quantify our certainty in our identification that the cluster of events is all earthquakes, we compute various probabilities. It might seem at first glance that, if one method classifies event 8 as an explosion and another method classifies it as an earthquake, then there is a 50/50 chance that it is either an explosion or an earthquake. But that is not the case if we seek to reconcile the complementary information contained in both methods together. We are able to determine which case has a higher probability of being correct.</p>
<p>From the correlation measurements and high-precision locations, we identify these 13 events as a cluster of similar events, all of the same event type. From an interpretation of the locations and focal mechanism, we identify all of these to be earthquakes. From the discriminant data, we initially identified 12 out of the 13 to be earthquakes based on data from MDJ alone. If we assume the correlation and location data are correct that these are all earthquakes, then we can compute the probabilities that the discriminant data are correct because it initially identified that 12 out of the 13 events are earthquakes. This translates to a 92% (12/13) probability that all are earthquakes, which is a high degree of confidence, as identified by the discriminant data being consistent with the correlation and location data. It also computes an 8% (1/13) probability that these are all explosions, which is a very low probability identified by the discriminant data and inconsistent with the correlation and location data. Put another way, the misclassification probability that event 8 is an earthquake incorrectly identified as an explosion is 92%, which is a high probability of the error occurring by chance, assuming that the correlation and location data are correct. The misclassification probability that the 12 other events are really explosions but would be incorrectly identified as earthquakes is only 8%, which is a relatively low probability of error, assuming all 13 are the same event type.</p>
<p>The misclassification probability <i>p</i> of the linear discriminant without the benefit of the correlation data was 0.5%, which applies equally to the 12 events classified as earthquakes considered individually and the 1 event classified as an explosion. This applies to a single-event approach and to event 8 being an earthquake misclassified as an explosion. If event 8 is really an explosion, it has a (1 &minus; <i>p</i>) = 99.5% probability of being correctly identified by the discriminant, using data from MDJ alone. If the misclassification is due to random noise that is uncorrelated, that means that the probability of the discriminant misclassifying all 12 events it identifies as earthquakes is <i>p</i><sup>12</sup> = 0.005<sup>12</sup>, which is near zero. The correlation and location data identify the cluster of 13 events as all earthquakes. The probability for the misclassification of the entire cluster as earthquakes when it should be all explosions is 0.995 &times; 0.005<sup>12</sup> &asymp; 0, assuming the discriminant identification is correct in getting event 8 right as an explosion and the other 12 events wrong as earthquakes.</p>
<p>The correlation, location, and discriminant data all initially agreed that 12 of these events are earthquake, but what about the problem event 8 for which they are inconsistent? Neither method has 100% accuracy, so we have estimated the probabilities of the various cases above to determine which has a greater probability of being correct. We have done this by considering the assumptions for one being correct and the other not being correct for the identification because both cannot be correct. The following enumerates the possibilities stating the assumptions: (1) The probability of the correlation identification of the cluster as all earthquakes being incorrect is (1 &minus; <i>p</i>) <i>p</i><sup>12</sup> = 0.995 &times; 0.005<sup>12</sup> &asymp; 0, assuming the discriminant identification from MDJ data is correct; (2) The probability of the discriminant identification of 12 earthquakes being incorrect is 8%, assuming the correlation identification is correct; (3) The probability of the discriminant identification of one explosion from MDJ data being incorrect is 92%, assuming the correlation identification is correct; (4) The probability of the discriminant identification of a single event being incorrect is <i>p</i> = 0.5% without the benefit of independent correlation identification; (5) The probability of there being at least 1 event in 13 earthquakes being misidentified as an explosion by the discriminant alone is 1 &minus; (1 &minus; <i>p</i>)<sup>13</sup> = 6.3%.</p>
<p>The benefit of using two methods of identification with independent data can be seen with the first three calculations that produce strong evidence that these 13 events are all earthquakes, which is what the correlation identification indicated, and that event 8 was misclassified as an explosion by the discriminant data at MDJ with much greater statistical significance, as determined by the probabilities. This is compared with the statistical significance of the discriminant data by itself for the 13 events, which is not significant at the 0.05 level (6.3% &gt; 5%), given a cluster of 13 events.</p>
<p>The calculation of (5) the probability that at least one event out of <i>N</i> events is misclassified is 1 minus the probability that all <i>N</i> events are correctly classified. The probability that one event is correctly classified is (1 &minus; <i>p</i>), so the probability that <i>N</i> events are correctly classified is (1 &minus; <i>p</i>)<i><sup>N</sup></i>, which gives 1 &minus; (1 &minus; <i>p</i>)<i><sup>N</sup></i> as the probability that at least one event of <i>N</i> is misclassified. For 13 events in our cluster and a <i>p</i> = 0.5%, this has a 6.3% probability of occurring by chance. Therefore, the observation of at least one misclassification is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. All 13 events identified as being earthquakes is the only statistically significant conclusion of those presented here, consistent with all the probability analysis.</p>
